- Only exposed modules and their dependencies should be processed and included in the IR
  - Start with exposed modules
  - Build dependency graph using either:
    - the IR if it exists, the module is available in it, and it hasn't changed since last build
    - imports in the module after parsing
  - When a module is not available:
    - Find which package it belongs to (find out where to split the Elm module name into Morphir package and module name)
    - 
- Only modules where the source changed since the last IR build should be processed
- All dependents of changed modules should be validated: resolved, type checked, property checked and tested
